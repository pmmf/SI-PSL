# SI-PSL database
Signer-Independent Portuguese Sign Language (SI-PSL) database

## Overview
<p align="justify">
The SI-PSL database was specially created for signer-independent evaluation purposes. It contains 31 isolated signs, representing the alphabet and the cardinal numbers 0 to 9 of the Portuguese sign language. All the signs were performed three times by a total of 11 native signers, in a free and natural signing environment, without any clothing restriction but with a slightly-controlled uniform background (see Figure below). Therefore, it clearly depicts the large inter-signer variability that exists in the manual signing process of sign languages. The proposed SI-PSL is made publicly available for benchmark purposes, in order to foster the signer-independent SLR research.

## Data and annotations
<p align="justify">
The images of the SI-PSL are 8-bit RGB color images with a resolution of 640x480 pixels. Each image of the database has a corresponding annotation file with the bounding box coordinates of the hands.

## Evaluation protocol
<p align="justify">
The SI-PSL database has a well-defined standard evaluation protocol, which consists of:
</p>
- 6 signers for training;
- 1 signer for validation;
- 4 signers foe test.
