# SI-PSL database
Signer-Independent Portuguese Sign Language (SI-PSL) database

## Overview
The SI-PSL database was specially created for signer-independent evaluation purposes. It contains 31 isolated signs, representing the alphabet and the cardinal numbers 0 to 9 of the Portuguese sign language. All the signs were performed three times by a total of 11 native signers, in a free and natural signing environment, without any clothing restriction but with a slightly-controlled uniform background (see Figure below). Therefore, it clearly depicts the large inter-signer variability that exists in the manual signing process of sign languages. The proposed SI-PSL is made publicly available for benchmark purposes, in order to foster the signer-independent SLR research.

## Data and annotations
They are 8-bit RGB color images with a resolution of 768x560 pixels. For image of the SI-PSL database 

## Evaluation protocol
The SI-PSL database has a well-defined standard evaluation protocol, which consists of 6 signers for training, 1 signer for validation and the remaining 4 signers are used for the test set.


## Terms of use
