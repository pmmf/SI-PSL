# SI-PSL database
Signer-Independent Portuguese Sign Language (SI-PSL) database

### Overview
The SI-PSL database contains 31 isolated signs, representing the alphabet and the cardinal numbers 0 to 9 of the Portuguese sign language. All the signs were performed three times by a total of 11 native signers, in a free and natural signing environment, without any clothing restriction but with a slightly-controlled uniform background (see Figure below). This variability, together with the large number of sign classes, makes this dataset a rather challenging one.

### Data and annotations
They are 8-bit RGB color images with a resolution of 768x560 pixels. For image of the SI-PSL database 

### Evaluation protocol
The SI-PSL database has a well-defined standard evaluation protocol, which consists of 6 signers for training, 1 signer for validation and the remaining 4 signers are used for the test set.
